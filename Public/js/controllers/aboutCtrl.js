My primary goals during this period were to learn how the financial markets work, learn how to manage my own finances, and then transition back into a career I am more passionate about. During this time, I was always a top performer, changing roles often to learn various aspects of the industry, and soaking up as much knowledge as I could. These goals have been achieved and it is now time to get back to an area more inline with my natural interests â€“ software development."
