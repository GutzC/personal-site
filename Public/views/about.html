            <p>My past eight years have been spent working full-time in the Financial industry, soaking up as much knowledge as I could. However, my goals have been achieved and it is time to move on. I am excited to get back to working in an area more inline with my natural interests â€“ software development.</p>

            <p>For the last few years I have been taking Computer Science classes, part-time during the evenings, at Utah Valley University. I love learning and have enjoyed having the freedom to pick classes that interest me versus pursuing a certificate.</p>

            <p>I am currently taking a semester off from school and have jumped into front-end development with both feet. I have recently completed an intensive full-time three-month "boot camp" at DevMountain, where I was able to sit down and code/learn 10-12 hours each day. It was awesome! The primary languages studied were related to the full MEAN stack, but I can't wait to pick up additional languages/technologies/practices in the future.</p>

            <p>I am now searching for my first full-time development position. I feel that this is a critical and exciting step for me.  I am a strong team player and will be an excellent addition to your organization.</p>
